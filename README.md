<h1>Unity 6 Practice Project</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  This repository serves as a playground for testing and practicing features in Unity 6. It contains experimental work and showcases various implementations using the different Unity features.
  I also maintain an older project designed for earlier Unity versions, which you can explore <a href="https://github.com/bekker-volodymyr/Test-And-Practice">here</a>. 
  I'm currently considering merging the older project into this one to unify development efforts and leverage new tools available in Unity 6.

<h2>Animation</h2>

<h3>Blending animations for Humanoid characters</h3>

<p>
This project part explores animation techniques for a humanoid character in Unity, focusing on smooth transitions and layered animations. Key implementations include:
1. 2D Blend Tree for Movement: Blends various movement animations dynamically based on player input, creating seamless transitions.
2. Additive Layer for Crouch Animation: Demonstrates how to overlay crouching motions onto existing animations using additive blending.
3. Synchronized Animations: Implements synced animations with varying walking speeds for a polished and natural feel.
4. Layered Animations with Avatar Masks: Combines walking and aiming animations simultaneously by utilizing avatar masks and layered blending.
</p>

<p>
This work highlights practical applications of Unity's animation system, emphasizing flexibility and realism.
